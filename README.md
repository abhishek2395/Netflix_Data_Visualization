# Netflix_Data_Visualization
- To understand what content is available in different countries.
- To obtain Insights on growing trends in top media-consuming countries.
- Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV shows rather than movies in recent years?

### Why this Project topic:
I was never a big fan of Netflix and never had a subscription for the same until Quarantine hit the states,
and I started binge-watching movies and few TV shows on that platform. That is when I realized Netflix
had grown its name over the years, and I wanted to know many insights that it had. In 2018, a blog
discharged a fascinating report, which shows that the quantity of TV appears on Netflix has almost
significantly increased since 2010. The spilling administration's number of motion pictures has diminished
by over 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has about significantly increased. It will be
fascinating to investigate what every other knowledge gathered from the dataset.
